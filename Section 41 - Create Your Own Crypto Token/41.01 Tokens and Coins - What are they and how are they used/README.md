# Tokens and Coins: What are they and how are they used?

## Introduction to Creating Tokens on the Internet Computer

In this lecture, we will learn how to create your own tokens on the Internet Computer. This is an exciting opportunity because you have probably heard about tokens like Shiba Inu, Doge, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Now, we will create our own custom tokens, such as Angela Coin or Amy Coin, and explore how building these crypto tokens on the blockchain actually works.

### Difference Between Tokens and Coins

A common question is: What is the difference between a token and a coin? For example, you might hear about the Shiba Inu token or the Doge coin. The key distinction is that to have a coin, you need your own blockchain, which means building a blockchain from scratch. In contrast, tokens take advantage of existing blockchains such as Ethereum or the Internet Computer blockchain.

### Examples: Dogecoin and Shiba Token

One well-known coin is Dogecoin, which is a meme coin. There is also a meme token called Shiba token, created as a "Doge killer." Dogecoin has its own blockchain, which is essentially a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain. Someone created a fork called Lucky Coin, and Dogecoin was created as a fork of Lucky Coin as a joke. Despite this, Dogecoin has a huge amount of trading, with a current market cap of around 17 billion dollars.

On the other hand, the Shiba token is often called a coin, but it is actually a token because it was built on the Ethereum blockchain. It does not have its own blockchain and was much easier to create. The creators were very smart at marketing and leveraged the growing number of Ethereum users. Its market cap is just behind Dogecoin, at around 14 billion dollars.

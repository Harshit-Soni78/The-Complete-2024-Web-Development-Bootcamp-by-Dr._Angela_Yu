# The Family Travel Tracker

## Introduction to the Family Travel Tracker

Now that we have seen all of these different types of relationships and created these relationships, we have done a significant amount of work around how to join tables, set up relationships, primary keys, and foreign keys. It is now time to apply all of that knowledge into a real exercise where we have to think and come up with the results ourselves. This is the part where we convert information into knowledge—something that is taught into something that is truly understood.

## Upgrading to a Family Travel Tracker

We are now going to build an upgrade to the Travel Tracker: a Family Travel Tracker. Suppose your family has four members—you, your husband, your son, your daughter, etc.—and you want to track everyone's travels across the world. You now need to establish relationships between your tables. If we apply all our new knowledge, we can end up with a system where clicking on a family member's tab shows all the places they have been. You can add countries for each member, and the data remains unique to each person.

For example, if Jack has now been to Canada and you click ADD, that populates the Jack tab and his countries. He has been to a total of three countries now, but if you go back to Angela, it is unchanged for her, and she has been to four countries. There is also an additional page, "Add a Family Member." When you click on that tab, you can add a new member, such as Amy, pick a color for her, and add her to the list. If Amy recently went to Greenland, you can add that country, and it is unique to Amy and does not affect other users.

# Travel Tracker Part 1: Building a Country Tracking App with Node.js and Postgres

## Introduction to the Travel Tracker Exercise

In this exercise, we will build a website that allows us to track all the countries we have visited. The starting file for this lesson is named `8.3 Travel Tracker.zip`. Unzip it and use `npm install` to install all required modules.

## Application Overview

The goal is to create an app where we can enter countries we have visited. This app is backed by a Postgres database. We will enter data into the database, and our front-end will display the countries in a visually appealing way.

# React Dependencies & Styling the Keeper App

## Introduction to Styling the Keeper App

Now that most of the functionality is complete, the next step is to tidy things up and improve the appearance of the app. The end result aimed for, after all the styling, includes icons, expanding input features, button hover effects, and a patterned background.

## Preparing the Project for Styling

To create these effects, pre-built components will be used by adding dependencies. It is recommended to use the provided starting project or download a fresh copy if working locally, as there are changes in `styles.css` and a className added to the form in `CreateArea`. Without these, the UI may look different from the intended design. Fork the starting project to ensure consistency.

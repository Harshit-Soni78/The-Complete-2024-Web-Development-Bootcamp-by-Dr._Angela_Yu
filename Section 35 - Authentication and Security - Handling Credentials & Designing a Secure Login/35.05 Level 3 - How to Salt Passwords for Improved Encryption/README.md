# Level 3 - How to Salt Passwords for Improved Encryption

## Introduction to Salting Passwords

Now that we have examined some vulnerabilities associated with hashed passwords, it is time to level up and learn about a method to prevent dictionary attacks and hash table cracking. This method is called salting.

### What is Salting?

We already know that hashing involves taking a password and running it through a hash function to produce a hash stored in our database. However, passwords generated by humans tend to be insecure; they are often short and consist of dictionary words, making them easy to look up and create hash tables for.

Salting takes hashing a step further. In addition to the password, a random set of characters called a salt is generated. This salt is combined with the user's password and then passed through the hash function. The resulting hash is created from both the password and the unique salt.

This means that no matter how simple the user's password is, adding the salt increases its complexity and length, thereby making the user database much more secure.

### Example of Salting

Consider the previous problem where three users had the same password, which was evident because they all had the same hash. If we had generated a random salt for each user and combined it with their password before hashing, their hashes would be different in the database.

For example, if Emily's password is "qwerty" and we generate a random salt, we append the salt to her password and then hash the combined string. This hash will differ from Tony's or Angela's hashes because their salts are different.

The salt is stored in the database alongside the hash, and the user does not need to remember it. When the user logs in, their entered password is combined with the stored salt, and if the resulting hash matches the stored hash, the password is correct.

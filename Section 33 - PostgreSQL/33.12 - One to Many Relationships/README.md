# One to Many Relationships

## Introduction to One to Many Relationships

In the previous lesson, we explored One to One Relationships. Now, let's examine the next type of relationship that we can create in our Postgres database. This is probably one of the most frequently used relationships: the One to Many relationship. In many cases, this is the relationship you will often rely on because it occurs very frequently in data storage.

The way a One to Many relationship works is if you consider a case where you have something that has only one record, for example, one student, but that student has many of some other type of data. This results in a One to Many relationship.

# What are Cycles and the ICP Token?

## Introduction to Cycles and Deployment on the Internet Computer

To progress in our understanding of working with the Internet Computer, the next significant topic to address is the concept of Cycles. This concept enables us to deploy our creations onto the live Internet Computer network.

So far, we have been developing locally using a simulated version of the Internet Computer. This approach helps us understand lag times and verify that our applications function correctly. Essentially, we have been testing our applications locally.

## Deploying Applications to the Live Network

Once development is complete, the goal is to deploy our applications onto the live network. This deployment makes the applications accessible to anyone across the Internet and places them on the ICP blockchain, with all the associated benefits.

However, deploying an app onto the network requires consuming computational resources from data centers worldwide. Therefore, there must be a mechanism to pay for these resources.

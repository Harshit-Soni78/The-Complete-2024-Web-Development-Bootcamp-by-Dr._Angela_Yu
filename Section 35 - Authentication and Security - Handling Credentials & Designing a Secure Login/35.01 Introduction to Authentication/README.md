# Introduction to Authentication

In this module, we will tackle the topic of Authentication. Although it is often considered incredibly complicated, it does not have to be. We will take it step by step, from beginning to end, to provide an overview of the entire process of setting up authentication from scratch.

## Why Do We Need to Authenticate?

As we create our website or web application for users, these users will start generating data on the website. They might like certain posts, interact with other users, create messages or recipesâ€”there will always be some user data created. To associate those pieces of data with individual users, we need to create an account for each user.

Users sign up to our website using a username and a password. Essentially, we create an ID card for them to uniquely identify them in our database and save all the data they generate onto that account. The next time they return to the website, they can use their username and password to log in and access all of their possibly private information.

This prevents everyone from being able to see private messages you send on platforms like Facebook or direct messages on Twitter. Authentication is simple in this regard.

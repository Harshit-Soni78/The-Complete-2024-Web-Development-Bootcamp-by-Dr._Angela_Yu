# Tip from Angela - How to Build Your Own Product

Now, I know many of you are taking this course because you want to build your own project or your own app.

## Considering the Entrepreneurial Path

What are some of the things to think about when you want to pursue the path of becoming an entrepreneur or starting a startup?

One of the most important things is to know what the most core features of your product are. Really get clarity.

Map it out, draw it out, write out all the bullets and all the functionality that you want, and then simplify it. Boil it down to the core fundamental thing that is different about your product and how it is going to stand out in the market.

Once you have that clarity, try to build the simplest version of your product. Do not start right at the end.

I often hear students say they want to build something that is a cross between Facebook and Twitter, with a sprinkle of Snapchat. That project is probably not going to happen.

If it does, it is not going to go well because it is too ambitious to start with.

What you want to do is start off building something like a skateboard, then build something more like a pushbike, then go up to a bicycle, and then go up to a car.

Instead of setting your ambitions on 'I am going to build this fantastic Ferrari' and then, when your motivation wanes, you have only built four wheels and nobody can use it.

That will not motivate you to keep building, and you will probably give up on the project.

So start small. Start with the core functionality. Build it and then get feedback.

The quicker you can get into this feedback loop where people are using your product and giving you tips on what else they would like to see, what is not working well in the app, or what would improve their user experience, the better.

Then you can start improving on it and enter a product development cycle. That is really crucial for success as an entrepreneur.

Have a think about these points and see if you can apply them to your project.

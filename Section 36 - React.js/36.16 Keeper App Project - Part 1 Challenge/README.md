# Keeper App Project - Part 1 Challenge

This is an exciting moment. We are finally ready to apply everything that we have learned so far to start building our final project, the Keeper app.

In this lesson, I have a challenge for you that will get us part of the way towards our final product.

Here is what we are aiming for: a Header component, a Note component, and a Footer component.

In the index.js file, I have outlined all the steps you need to follow to complete this challenge.

If you prefer to work on this project locally instead of on CodeSandbox, the simplest way is to go to the link listed in the Course Resources for the starting project. Once there, click the button to export the project as a zip file. After downloading, unzip the file to obtain the project folder.

Once you have your project folder, you can drag it into your VS Code and add it to your workspace. You may remove any previous folders you have been working on.

Expanding all the files, you will see the same starting files: index.html, styles.css, and index.js as a JSX file. The index.html file is kept very simple, containing a title, a link to Google Fonts, and a link to the stylesheet inside styles.css. There is also a prerequisite div with the id of "root".

The styles.css file already contains a number of styles and classes that you will apply to the React code you write. You can choose to work on this in CodeSandbox or in your local environment set up in the previous lesson.

If you decide to work locally, I recommend opening your terminal and navigating to your project directory. For example, in my case, it is located at Downloads/keeper-app-part-1. Then run "npm install" to install the react, react-dom, and react-scripts modules included with the package.

After installation, run "npm start" to launch the development server. You can then view the app in your browser at localhost:3000.

Whether you choose CodeSandbox or your local editor, the goals remain the same. You will create a new React app that includes an App component. Inside the App component, you will have three components: Header, Footer, and Note.

The Header component will display the Keeper app title or any title you decide to use. The Footer component will display a dynamically rendered year, not a static number. You will use your knowledge of JavaScript dates to display the current year.

The Note component will display a title and some content.

The final step is to ensure that the styling matches the sample completed app, which you can access via the provided link. To achieve the correct styling, you may need to examine the styles.css file to see which classes and HTML elements are targeted.

The goal is to test everything you have learned so far. You can also update the styles.css file to customize the style as you wish, or delete it and create your own styles from scratch.

I recommend going through each of the points in index.js and trying to complete them. Once you have finished the challenge, proceed to the next lesson where I will go through the solution with you. Pause the video now and try to complete the challenge.

## Key Takeaways

- Initiated the Keeper app project by setting up essential React components: Header, Note, and Footer.
- Explained how to download and set up the project locally using npm for dependencies and running the development server.
- Emphasized the use of JavaScript Date object to dynamically render the current year in the Footer component.
- Encouraged customization of styles by modifying or recreating the styles.css file to match or personalize the app's appearance.

# JSX Code Practice

## Introduction to the Challenge

In this challenge, you will work with a prepared CodeSandbox environment. The first step is to fork the CodeSandbox so that you can keep a copy of your work. If you are logged in, you will be able to save your progress and return to it later.

The goal is to create a React application from scratch by following the comments step by step and completing the challenge accordingly.

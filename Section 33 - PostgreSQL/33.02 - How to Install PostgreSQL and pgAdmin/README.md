6\. Continue through the installer, leave everything as the default and just keep clicking **Next**. Once installation completes then you're done you can click **Finish** and you can continue to the next lesson!

NOTE: If Stack Builder launches after installation completes, just close it. We will be doing everything from scratch together in the next lesson without using a wizard.

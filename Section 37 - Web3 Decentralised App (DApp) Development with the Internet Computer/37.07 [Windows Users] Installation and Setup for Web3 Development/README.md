# \[Windows Users\] Installation and Setup for Web3 Development

This lesson is designed for Windows users to install and set up the environment for Internet Computer development. Although the process is somewhat lengthy, I will guide you step by step through everything you need to do. By following the documentation linked in this lesson and watching the video beforehand, you should be able to complete the setup successfully. If there are any updates, the documentation will be revised accordingly.

## System Requirements

First, ensure that your system meets the necessary requirements. Open the Start menu and search for "System Information" to check your operating system version. You should be running at least Windows 10, version 2004 or above. You can verify this by looking at the version number; it should be 19041 or higher. Windows 11 or newer versions are also compatible.

Additionally, confirm that your system is 64-bit by checking the "System Type" field, which should display "x64". Unfortunately, 32-bit systems are not supported for this setup.

# What is the Internet Identity?

## Introduction to Internet Identity

Up to this point, we have been claiming our DANG tokens into the current logged-in user of the frontend, which in my case happens to have this Principal ID. However, the problem with this is that this is actually just an anonymous user. It is not a real user at all because we are not logged in. This user operating the website has no Principal ID to give our backend to use.

You may have noticed that when you logged in to, for example, the Network Nervous System, or when you initially signed up to get your free cycles from ICP, you had to go through a login process. This login process asked you to create an Internet Identity. When you create an Internet Identity, you are able to assign a device to that Internet Identity anchor, and it asks you to verify your identity using either a USB security key or your current laptop device, which in my case lets me log in using Touch ID.

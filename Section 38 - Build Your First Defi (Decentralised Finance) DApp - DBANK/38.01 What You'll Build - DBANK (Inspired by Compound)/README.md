# What You'll Build - DBANK (Inspired by Compound)

## Introduction to Building a DeFi Application

We are going to get started by building our first decentralized finance (DeFi) application. In the process, we will learn how to program for the Internet Computer using the Motoko language.

## Project Inspiration: Compound Protocol

The project we are building is inspired by the Compound protocol, which is a money market protocol. Essentially, Compound allows people to lend and borrow their tokens.

For example, users can supply their Ether and earn interest on it, or borrow a token such as the Chainlink token, betting that the token's price will have decreased by the time they repay their loan.

Compound collects interest paid by borrowers and distributes that interest to lenders of the token, while also taking a small fee for the service.

## Our First Project: Earning Interest on Token Balances

For our first project, we will write code to earn interest on a token balance using Motoko.

## What is Motoko?

Motoko is not related to "Ghost in the Shell." Instead, it is a programming language designed and created by the Dfinity team, led by Andreas Rossberg, one of the original co-creators of WebAssembly.

Motoko is a modern, general-purpose programming language specifically designed for creating Internet Computer smart contracts.

As we start using Motoko, you will notice many similarities to other programming languages you might already know, such as JavaScript, Swift, TypeScript, C, or Java.

As we build more applications using Motoko, you will find it easy to switch from whichever programming language you have learned before.

## Embracing Programmer Flexibility

As programmers, we constantly encounter new programming languages and paradigms. It is a great exercise in programmer flexibility to learn new languages quickly and adapt to them.

Once you are ready, proceed to the next lesson to start learning all about Motoko and how to build your very own decentralized application on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).

## Key Takeaways

- Built a decentralized finance (DeFi) application inspired by the Compound protocol.
- Learned about the Motoko programming language designed for Internet Computer smart contracts.
- Understood the basics of money market protocols allowing lending and borrowing of tokens.
- Recognized the importance of programmer flexibility in learning new languages like Motoko.

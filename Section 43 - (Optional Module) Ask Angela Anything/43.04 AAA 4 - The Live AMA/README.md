# AAA 4 - The Live AMA

## Introduction to the Live AMA

This is Angela from the brewery, excited to host the first-ever live AMA. For those who have been with me for a long time, you might recall the live "Ask Angela Anything" sessions from earlier courses. This event aims to reconnect and check in on how everyone is doing while safely at home. Although this is my first time doing something like this live, I hope it goes well and I get to know more of you.

## AMA Format and Question Handling

The plan is to address some of the questions submitted ahead of time. Over the past week, you have posted questions on the ask page, and our team has compiled the most upvoted ones. We will tackle those first, then move on to live questions from YouTube. There appears to be minimal delay in the chat, so I hope to engage in some back-and-forth interaction.

### Managing Multiple Programming Languages

Melissa Santos asked: How do you manage using different languages for different projects without mixing up the syntax?

I admit I mix up syntax frequently, especially when switching between projects like Swift and JavaScript. For example, after working on a Swift project for a while, switching to JavaScript might cause me to miss semicolons or write incorrect code. Fortunately, good linters and code editors like Atom, VS Code, or Sublime help catch these issues. I rely on tools to handle syntax, while I focus on the logic, which is the hardest part.

### Fluency in One Language Before Moving On

Melissa also asked if it's a good idea to become fluent in one language before learning others.

It depends on your goals. If your end project is an iOS app, becoming proficient in Swift first is essential. However, if your project occasionally requires web development or a Flutter app for iOS and Android, you can dive into the necessary language as needed. Programming languages are tools, not academic subjects. Like learning to use a hammer or saw, you don't need to master one tool fully before trying another. It depends on what you want to build.

### Competition in Remote Work

Jp RD asked about the competitiveness of remote jobs, especially with the impact of coronavirus increasing demand.

Competition is natural when something is desirable. Many people want to work from home and enjoy flexibility, so competition will be high. However, things worth doing are worth competing for. Focus on your ultimate goal, such as becoming a web or app developer, and don't worry excessively about competition or the number of applicants. Concentrate on your skills and delivering quality work.

### Personal Experience with Competition

I trained as a medical doctor and worked in orthopedic surgery. From day one, I was told becoming a surgeon is extremely competitive, with odds like one in a thousand. Some specialties, like brain surgery, are even more competitive due to limited positions. This experience taught me that competition is a way of life. When you want something, others want it too. The key is to focus on yourself and your growth.

### Advice from Cal Newport's Book

A great book I recommend is "So Good They Can't Ignore You" by Cal Newport. The main idea is to become so good at what you do that others cannot ignore your talent. This applies to bosses, recruiters, or anyone else. I keep this in mind by focusing on delivering the best student experience in my courses, aiming for helpfulness, enjoyment, and completion rates. Avoid comparing yourself to others to prevent copying and losing originality.

### Getting a Job as a Full Stack Web Developer

Mayank Saini asked how to get a job as a full stack web developer at a dream company and what to master.

Having a clear goal is the first step. Many people don't know what they want, so you're already ahead. To understand how to get the job, think from the company's perspective. If you were a manager at Google hiring a web developer, you'd receive thousands of applications and need ways to filter them efficiently. Qualifications matter, but capability is key.

### Building a Portfolio to Showcase Skills

You need to build a portfolio that shows what you can do rather than just telling. Create web apps if you want to be a web developer or iOS apps if you want to be an iOS developer. Don't just replicate tutorials; stand out by building projects that reflect real-world tools and pain points. For example, if managers use Trello or Asana, build a Trello clone with added features that solve problems. This helps recruiters understand your skills and the value you bring.

### Thinking from the Recruiter's Point of View

Always consider the recruiter's perspective. They want to hire someone who can contribute effectively using the tools they use daily. Demonstrating familiarity with these tools through your projects makes you a more attractive candidate.

## Interactive Poll and Audience Engagement

We conducted a poll to learn where viewers are streaming from. Most participants are from Asia, followed by Europe and North America. This aligns with time zones: evening in Asia, daytime in Europe, and morning in North America.

### Learning New Coding Skills

Claudia asked about my process for learning new coding skills.

One of the most useful skills I've acquired is learning how to learn effectively. I break down topics into parts I need to learn based on my goal. For example, when learning German, I focus on listening and speaking rather than writing. I practice by repeating phrases and using tools like Google Translate to check my pronunciation. Watching shows with audio descriptions helps me match spoken language with context. The key is to break down the problem, set goals, and practice relevant skills repeatedly.

### Getting Good at Reading Documentation

Yuvraj Agarkar asked how to get good at reading docs.

Documentation quality varies. Apple's iOS documentation is minimalist, while Google's Flutter docs are comprehensive with examples and parameter explanations. Documentation alone isn't enough; it's like starting with a dictionary when learning a language. Instead, learn skills as needed, look up examples on StackOverflow, and read docs to understand methods in context. This approach is more effective than memorizing documentation.

### Starting a Startup

Starting a startup requires finding time and preparation. I began building a startup while working as a doctor with long hours. I used days off to work on my startup. There's no perfect time or opportunity; success comes from hard work and preparation. My late grandfather advised that opportunities come to those who are prepared. Overnight success is a myth; it takes many hours of effort before being ready to seize opportunities. For example, our Flutter course partnership with Google came after building a track record and quality courses.

### Building Real-World Projects

Dionysius asked about strategies to connect syntax and logic to build functional code.

Understanding syntax is easier than formulating logic to build projects. Our "100 Days of Code" course starts with guided tutorials and gradually reduces support, encouraging independent problem-solving. Like learning to ride a bike, initial support helps, but eventually, you must ride alone, which involves struggle. The best way to build projects is to start small, like building a skateboard before a car, and gradually increase complexity.

### SwiftUI vs UIKit

Regarding SwiftUI and UIKit, SwiftUI is improving but not yet mature enough for serious development or hiring needs. UIKit remains essential for getting hired. Our iOS 13 course will be updated gradually with more SwiftUI content, so no need to buy a new course.

### Pricing Software

Matea asked about pricing software.

Price your software based on what people are willing to pay. I prefer not to push sales aggressively; if people want the product, they will buy it. Pricing depends on appeal: mass-market products can be cheaper, while niche products may require higher prices to justify development effort. Our team aims to make courses affordable globally, considering different living conditions.

## Conclusion

Thank you to everyone who joined the live stream. I hope you continue coding and achieve success. Good night or good morning wherever you are.

# How does the Blockchain actually work?

## Introduction to Blockchain

We've been discussing various applications built on the blockchain, but what exactly is the blockchain, and how does the technology work?

The easiest way to think about the blockchain is as a ledger.

### What is a Ledger?

Imagine I went to lunch with my friend Jack, and he paid the bill. I could pull out a notepad and write: "Jack gave Angela 10 for lunch, and now Angela owes Jack 10."

This is the beginning of my ledger.

Later, if I buy Helena a coffee, I would record: "Angela gives Helena 5."

As I continue this ledger, it becomes a record of who owes whom and what amount, essentially a collection of data.

When I want to figure out how much I owe Jack, I can look at this ledger and see that I owe him 10.

However, there are two problems:

- First, Jack, Helena, and I all need to agree on which transactions should go into the ledger.
- Second, we have to trust the person holding the ledger not to modify the recorded transactions.

What if someone could simply modify this ledger? For example, adding a zero to change 10 into 100. This kind of data tampering makes paper ledgers worthless, and the same issues would arise if this ledger was on the Internet.

What we need is to make the history of transactions in this ledger immutable, essentially locked so it can no longer be changed.

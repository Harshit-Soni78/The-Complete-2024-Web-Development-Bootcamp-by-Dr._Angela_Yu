# AAA 3 - How to Start Freelancing and more

## Introduction

Welcome to this special episode of Ask Angela Anything, recorded from Nairobi, Kenya. Today, we will address some carefully selected questions from the audience, aiming to provide insightful answers and brighten your day with a scenic change from the usual London office environment.

### Starting Freelancing

Virak Ngauv asks for advice on starting freelancing. Angela shares her background, noting that although she trained as a medical doctor, she has been programming for many years and freelanced extensively during medical school. She emphasizes that freelancing should not be approached impulsively.

Do not quit your job immediately or abruptly. Contrary to popular belief, successful entrepreneurship does not require reckless risk-taking. For example, Richard Branson leased a plane to start Virgin Atlantic, minimizing his initial investment risk.

Instead, identify about 15 hours per week of spare time to dedicate to building a pet project. This project should be useful to at least one person, whether yourself, a family member, or even a pet. Avoid trivial projects like "hello world" applications. Deploy your project on the web or app stores to begin building a portfolio that demonstrates your capabilities to potential clients or employers.

### Gaining Freelance Experience

After dedicating time to your pet project, allocate another 12 to 15 hours per week to freelancing on small gigs. Platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and oDesk are excellent starting points. Focus on projects that take no longer than a week to complete, such as bug fixes, updates, maintenance, or small improvements.

The goal is not immediate financial gain but skill acquisition and understanding the freelancing ecosystem. Building a track record with positive client testimonials and effective communication is crucial. Regular updates to clients about your progress help build trust and demonstrate professionalism.

As you complete projects, you will develop a client list and receive referrals, which, combined with your portfolio, will help you network and attract more work. Over time, you will transition to larger projects and collaborations, becoming a fully-fledged freelance developer.

## Daily Schedule

Amit Singh asks about Angela's daily schedule. She describes an ideal day when based in London without special plans.

- **Morning (9:00 - 10:30):** Dedicated learning time, typically 1 to 2 hours, focusing on new skills or technologies when cognitive function is highest. For example, Angela recently studied Selenium WebDriver to automate tasks like renewing library books and booking gym classes.
- **Midday:** Creative work such as developing lesson plans, curricula, or development projects requiring high cognitive demand.
- **Lunch:** Approximately 30 minutes, focusing on light meals to maintain alertness.
- **Afternoon:** Walking meetings or solo walks to stimulate productivity, followed by less demanding tasks like video editing or client meetings.
- **Late Afternoon (4:00 - 5:00 PM):** Email checking time, with notifications turned off during other periods to avoid distractions.
- **Evening:** Winding down with activities based on remaining cognitive energy, such as playing video games, reading non-fiction or fiction, or playing the strategic game Go.

## Cross-Platform vs Native App Development

Pascal Heimlicher inquires about the comparison between cross-platform and native app development.

- **Native Development:** Considered the gold standard, especially for large companies with ample resources. It offers superior speed, performance, and access to exclusive APIs (e.g., push notifications, health kits). Extensive resources and community support exist for native platforms like iOS Swift.

  However, native development requires separate codebases for Android and iOS, leading to higher costs, longer development times, and resource-intensive maintenance.

- **Cross-Platform Development:** Frameworks like React Native allow developers to use familiar languages (e.g., JavaScript) to build apps for both Android and iOS, reducing development time and effort.

  Downsides include incomplete access to some native features, the need for occasional native code, and licensing concerns due to Facebook's ownership and licensing terms.

Angela advises choosing the approach based on project requirements, weighing pros and cons case by case.

## Helpful Developer Tools

Angela shares her favorite tools that enhance developer productivity:

- **Duet:** Enables using an iPad or iPhone as a secondary or tertiary display for laptops or desktops, providing a multi-screen experience.
- **Alfred:** A powerful search and productivity application for Mac that offers faster and more relevant results than Spotlight, with customizable queries.
- **Momento:** A Chrome plugin that displays inspiring images, a to-do list, weather, and time on new tabs, helping focus on daily tasks.
- **Cheat Sheet:** Software that shows keyboard shortcuts for the current application when holding down the command key, aiding workflow efficiency.

Additionally, Angela mentions a humorous website called "Canned Emails" offering pre-written emails for various situations, including client communications.

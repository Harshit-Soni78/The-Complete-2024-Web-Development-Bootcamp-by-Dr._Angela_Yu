# AAA 1 - How to Soak in Programming Concepts and More

## Introduction to Udemy iOS 11 Course AMA

Welcome to the very first AMA session for the Udemy iOS 11 course. We have conducted similar sessions on other platforms and thought it would be enjoyable to engage with you here as well. We hope you find this session valuable. In the future, we will announce more AMA sessions, so please stay tuned and submit any questions you have for upcoming episodes.

## AMA Format and Question Selection

We received numerous questions, but can only answer a selection. Our team has chosen questions that are broadly applicable rather than specific technical issues or bugs. This approach ensures maximum benefit for all students. The AMA focuses on general questions that appeal to everyone.

### Question from Handel Callender

Handel asked two questions:

- Are you looking forward to the new Star Trek television show?
- Are you a science fiction fan?

Let's address these one at a time.

I have never really gotten into Star Trek because it seemed to me like a series of meetings in every episode, which I found difficult to engage with. However, I am a huge science fiction fan as a genre. Recent favorites include _Ex Machina_, _Blade Runner 2049_ (a slow burner but excellent), and _Arrival_, which I found incredible.

### Strategies for Soaking in Programming Concepts

This is a great question and one we discuss often in our in-person boot camps. I recall an AMA with Elon Musk where he described knowledge as a huge semantic tree. The approach is to first master the trunk and fundamentals, then move to large branches, smaller branches, and finally the leaves and decorative elements.

Focusing on superficial things without a fundamental understanding is ineffective because these "leaves" have nothing to attach to.

With programming specifically, it is essential to start creating your own projects. Tutorials and algorithmic challenges are helpful, but making projects you conceive yourself leads to significant leaps in understanding. I encourage students to think of simple apps they want to build, such as a timer or calculator, and start there.

Avoid overly ambitious projects initially, as complexity can become unmanageable and discouraging. Instead, create a minimum viable product that works well, even if it is simple like a skateboard rather than a Ferrari. Once the core functionality is solid, you can add features incrementally.

Along the way, you will encounter unknown challenges and will need to learn how to find solutions independently. No course can teach every detail, so learning to research effectively using resources like Stack Overflow, Google, and official documentation is crucial. Being skilled at formulating search queries is a key developer skill.

## Getting a Paying Job in iOS Development

A question from Glen-udemy asks how to get a paying job in iOS development when skills are not yet professional level. The key is to do more development, ideally in a job or team context, to improve.

To build experience without prior work, consider freelancing on platforms like Upwork, oDesk, or Fiverr. Although pay may be low initially, working on real projects with real clients builds your portfolio and skills.

This approach is a "get rich really slowly" formula but is effective. Positive client relationships and testimonials can help you increase your rates as you gain proficiency. This path offers more rapid learning than only seeking junior roles at companies.

## Starting iOS Development and University Experience

Roland Gavrilescu asks about how I started learning iOS development and my university experience at UCL.

I began iOS development in 2011 during medical school, motivated by a desire to build a medical app for testing diagnostic skills. My prior programming experience, including Visual Basic and C++, helped me learn quickly.

Understanding fundamentals like variables, data types, and methods applies across languages, so learning Swift builds on existing knowledge.

At university, I recommend pursuing courses with breadth to prepare for real-world challenges. Achieving perfect grades is less important than gaining diverse knowledge and experiences. University curricula are designed to introduce essential concepts that online tutorials may not cover systematically.

## Approach to Learning New Technology

Abhiji Sarode asks about my approach to learning new technology, handling obstacles, and timesaving hacks.

Technology evolves constantly, so continuous learning is necessary to avoid becoming outdated. I allocate dedicated daily time for learning unfamiliar topics, embracing discomfort to grow skills.

For example, I recently learned to build Alexa skills using NodeJS, brushing up on unfamiliar areas despite poor documentation.

When learning new skills, I identify similarities with what I already know to build connections. For instance, learning Spanish after French leverages common vocabulary. This approach helps extend existing knowledge efficiently.

## Staying Productive and Focused

Misha Espinoza asks about habits for productivity and focus.

Modern life is full of distractions from notifications on multiple devices. To protect focus, I turn off all notifications and sometimes disconnect from the Internet when working on creative tasks.

I view attention as a limited resource, like having ten dollars to spend daily. Conserving attention by minimizing trivial decisions, such as wearing similar clothes and eating the same breakfast (high-protein sardines), helps preserve energy for important work.

## Challenges as a Female Developer and Advice

Stephanie Kendall asks about challenges faced as a female in the industry and advice for women pursuing development careers.

I have faced rejections like everyone else but choose not to attribute them to gender, ethnicity, or age. Instead, I focus on factors within my control, such as preparation and effort.

Interpreting setbacks in ways that empower you to improve is more productive than blaming immutable characteristics. While systemic issues exist, personal agency in preparation and mindset is key.

## Morning Ritual

Bonn Elimanco asks about my morning ritual.

On an ideal day, I wake around 6:30 or 7 AM, start with ten proper press-ups to energize, then meditate for twenty minutes using Transcendental Meditation. Meditation helps me become more purposeful and manage emotional reactions.

After meditation, I journal to clear my mind and then catch up on tech news while eating breakfast. My routine aims to conserve attention and maximize productivity, though it evolves over time.

## Closing Remarks

Thank you for participating in this AMA. Keep asking questions in the QA section and stay engaged. Remember, persistence is key; if you get stuck, ask for help or search resources like Stack Overflow. I look forward to seeing the amazing projects you build and share.

Good luck, and see you in the course and future AMAs.

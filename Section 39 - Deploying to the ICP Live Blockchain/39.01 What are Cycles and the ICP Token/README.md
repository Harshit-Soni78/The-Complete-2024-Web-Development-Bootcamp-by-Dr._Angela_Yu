# What are Cycles and the ICP Token?

## Introduction to Cycles and Deployment on the Internet Computer

To progress in our understanding of working with the Internet Computer, the next significant topic to address is the concept of Cycles. This concept enables us to deploy our creations onto the live Internet Computer network.

So far, we have been developing locally using a simulated version of the Internet Computer. This approach helps us understand lag times and verify that our applications function correctly. Essentially, we have been testing our applications locally.

## Deploying Applications to the Live Network

Once development is complete, the goal is to deploy our applications onto the live network. This deployment makes the applications accessible to anyone across the Internet and places them on the ICP blockchain, with all the associated benefits.

However, deploying an app onto the network requires consuming computational resources from data centers worldwide. Therefore, there must be a mechanism to pay for these resources.

## ICP Tokens: The Currency of the Internet Computer

The most common way to pay for computational resources is by acquiring ICP Tokens. These Internet Computer Tokens are tradable and can be obtained through several methods:

- Purchasing or exchanging other cryptocurrencies for ICP tokens on large exchanges such as Coinbase.
- Participating in the Network Nervous System (NNS), which governs the Internet Computer.
- Receiving grants from the Dfinity Foundation.
- Operating data centers that run nodes for the Internet Computer network.

### Network Nervous System (NNS) and Neurons

The Internet Computer is controlled by the Network Nervous System (NNS), a governing system overseeing all aspects of the network. Users can lock their existing ICP Tokens to create a Neuron. By voting on proposals, participants earn rewards in ICP tokens, giving them direct influence over the network's future.

### Grants from the Dfinity Foundation

The Dfinity Foundation has allocated funds to support developers. By submitting proposals, developers can apply for grants ranging from 25,000 to 100,000 ICP tokens to aid in their projects. These grants come without any equity or ownership claims, serving as straightforward financial support.

### Running Data Centers

Dfinity connects multiple independent data centers worldwide to form a virtual shared computer. Individuals or organizations that own or operate such infrastructure and supply electricity can run nodes within the Internet Computer. In return, they receive ICP tokens as rewards for maintaining server availability.

## Converting ICP Tokens to Cycles

After acquiring ICP tokens, users can burn these tokens to exchange them for computation cycles within their canisters. This process converts a publicly tradable token into a non-tradable resource that powers canisters by enabling data storage and computation.

Canisters are preloaded with cycles, representing their computational potential. As long as a canister has sufficient cycles, it remains operational.

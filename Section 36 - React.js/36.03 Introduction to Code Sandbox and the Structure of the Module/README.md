# Introduction to Code Sandbox and the Structure of the Module

In order to get up and running straight away, I want to introduce you to a tool called CodeSandbox.

CodeSandbox is a browser-based development environment which allows you to instantly deploy whatever it is you build.

CodeSandbox was built with React in mind right from the beginning, and it contains features that will be really handy for us as we learn to build using React.

For example, you can code collaboratively with your friends. You have really good dependency management and installing and keeping track of npm packages, and it allows us to get up and running immediately without having to go through the hassle of installing React and dealing with different versions.

It is completely free to use, and it allows us to do something that's pretty cool where we can build an app in React.

This is one of the projects that we are going to be building in this module, and instantly we can have access to the final completed URL, so we can simply send this URL to our friends, our coworkers, put it into our portfolio, and you can see that it's a hosted version of something that we have built.

Throughout this module, we are going to be using CodeSandbox to introduce you to new skills in React. After you've learned the skill, then we will practice those skills in a separate sandbox.

It is through this skill practice that you are going to build up and level up your skills in React.

At some point, once you've acquired enough skills, I am going to introduce you to a part of the final project, the Keeper App, that we are going to be building.

We are going to break down the large Keeper app project into several parts so that you'll be able to apply all of the skills that you learned previously to complete each of these parts.

Hopefully, you will find that this process of using CodeSandbox to learn and practice your skills helps you learn React much quicker and establishes a solid foundation of knowledge.

I recommend following the URL in the course resources, which will take you to codesandbox.io and click on sign in to register with CodeSandbox.

If you have your GitHub account, this is seamless. You can simply just sign in with GitHub. Alternatively, you can also sign in with Google or with Apple.

Now, you might be thinking, we've been working with VS Code all this time, and we've been doing local development for a long time. Why switch to a browser-based editor now?

One of the biggest reasons is because we can have instant deployment without any hassle and without any cost.

The second reason is because with technological courses, every single update to React versions will change things ever so slightly, a little bit.

These changes happen every week and it is impossible for me to rerecord and update the course on such a frequent basis.

What I think is really important is teaching you the fundamental skills that get you thinking and get you to a point where you can independently research and learn things on your own.

It is not about teaching you everything there is to learn about React; it is to teach you all of the fundamental skills so that you can build anything you want to in the future.

That is why it is really helpful when dealing with a framework such as React, for me to teach it on something like CodeSandbox.

Because we are all working with the same versions in every single lesson, I will provide you links to the starting projects on CodeSandbox and links to the final projects on CodeSandbox as well.

We are all working with the same versions of React, and we are all looking at the same code and working in the same development environment.

This is important so that you do not run into a lot of headaches and you do not get into problems down the line.

It will make your experience so much more seamless, and we can focus on the learning rather than the small deprecations and the small changes in the framework.

If you really want to work with VS Code and develop locally, that is totally fine; that is completely up to you.

In the next lesson, I have a text lesson to show you how you can download VS Code, download React, and work with it locally.

However, I really do not recommend it because with every small update in the React framework, which is a framework controlled and built by Facebook, there will be small minute changes, which do not actually affect anything on a large scale.

If things update, you can always learn how to do it using documentation.

The important thing here is that we are working on the same environment and we focus on the really hard parts, such as functional programming, such as how to work with the React framework.

What are Hooks? How do we actually use a big front-end framework?

I strongly urge you to stick with me and follow along with what I recommend.

It just means that you will have so much less heartache, and once you have completed everything, once you've understood everything, you will be in a much better position if you want to explore local development.

I know it is a pain. It is yet another thing to sign up for, but at least it is completely free.

I promise you, I am not getting any kickbacks from any of these companies. I wish I was, but I spent a lot of time researching all of these products to find something that is free, accessible, and is the best option for our purpose, which is to learn as much as fast as possible.

## Key Takeaways

- CodeSandbox is a browser-based development environment designed for instant React app deployment.
- It offers collaborative coding, efficient dependency management, and eliminates local setup hassles.
- Using CodeSandbox ensures consistent React versions and a unified development environment for all learners.
- While local development with VS Code is possible, CodeSandbox is recommended for a smoother learning experience.

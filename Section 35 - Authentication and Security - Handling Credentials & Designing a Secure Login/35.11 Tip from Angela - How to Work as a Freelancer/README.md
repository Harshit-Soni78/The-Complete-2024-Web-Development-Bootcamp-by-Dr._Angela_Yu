# Tip from Angela - How to Work as a Freelancer

Now very often I hear students ask me about, "How can I become a freelancer?"

I want to work in Bali or I want to travel and I want to be able to at the same time work as a freelancer.

One of the best ways to get started is to build a portfolio and to build up a list of clients who can vouch for you, because if you want to get that top gig right at the beginning then it is going to be very, very hard without some references without something to show for it.

So the first thing I recommend students do is to go onto a website like Fiverr where people are not paying very much for any sort of service, but you know to practice working with a client, to figure out what it is that people want, to establish how you can better communicate with your clients, and make them happy and build the things that they want.

So even though you are not getting paid a lot in the beginning, at least you are working with real projects and real people,

and as you build up your skills, as you build more projects, then you will be able to go to websites like Upwork or Guru or Freelancer and be able to offer your services for slightly more.

Basically, do not shoot for the moon right at the beginning, instead, build up your reputation and build up your skills, while you are giving your clients excellent service for not very much money.

And this way, within a year or so, you will have enough projects to show off and enough clients who will vouch for you, then you can shoot for the moon.

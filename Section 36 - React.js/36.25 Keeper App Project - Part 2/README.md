# Keeper App Project - Part 2

## Introduction to Keeper App Enhancements

Since the last time we worked on our Keeper app, we have learned many new concepts such as props, mapping components, looping, React Dev Tools, arrow functions, and array methods like map, filter, and reduce. Let's now apply some of these concepts to improve our Keeper app.

## Starting the Keeper App Part 2

This is the Keeper app part 2. You can obtain the starting CodeSandbox from the course resources. If you prefer to work locally, download a copy, then run `npm install` followed by `npm start` to run it on a local server. If you are working in CodeSandbox, simply fork your own copy.

The goal of this challenge is straightforward: render all notes currently stored inside our `Notes.js` file, which contains an array called `notes`, into our Keeper app as separate `Note` components. This will utilize many concepts learned previously, especially props and mapping.

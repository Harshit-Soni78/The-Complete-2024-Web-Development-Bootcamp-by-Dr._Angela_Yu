# What We Will Make in This React Module

## Overview of Projects in This React Module

In this module, you will be creating several projects. One of these is a registration screen, similar to the example shown. Additionally, you will build a real-time clock application, an emoji dictionary, and a beautiful To-Do list.

## Main Project: Keeper App

The major project you will work towards is an application called Keeper, which is a clone of Google Keep. This app allows you to quickly take notes and add them to your personal Keeper app whenever you have new ideas.

## Technologies and Concepts Covered

To build these projects, you will learn many new technologies and tools, especially focusing on the React framework. This includes understanding JSX, Props, Components, Containers, and how to work with the Virtual DOM.

You will also learn about State management and Declarative Programming, including the use of React Hooks such as `useState`.

## Deep Dive into ES6 JavaScript

Another significant aspect of this module is learning many ES6 (also known as ES2015) JavaScript concepts. You will deepen your understanding of JavaScript by exploring features such as destructuring, the spread operator, `map` and `filter` methods, as well as `import` and `export` statements.

## Summary and Next Steps

As you can see, this is a jam-packed module designed to equip you with comprehensive knowledge of React. By the end of the course, you will be well-versed in React and ready to build beautiful frontends using this powerful framework.

I hope you are as excited as I am to get started. Head over to the next lesson, and let's begin writing some React code right away.

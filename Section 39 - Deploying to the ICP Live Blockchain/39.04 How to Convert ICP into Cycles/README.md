# How to Convert ICP into Cycles?

## Introduction to Cycles and ICP Tokens

One important aspect to be aware of is that cycles can run out. This may happen if you have created too many new canisters or hosted a file that is too large. When this occurs, you either have to continue with local development or acquire some ICP tokens.

Typically, the way to obtain ICP tokens is through a cryptocurrency exchange. Using an exchange, you can buy ICP tokens with your local currency, such as dollars or pounds. The largest and most established exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, and KuCoin, among others.

# What You'll Build - A Website to Mint, Buy and Sell NFTs

## Introduction to the NFT Marketplace Project

We are about to embark on an exciting project: building an NFT marketplace where users can mint, list, and sell non-fungible tokens on the Internet Computer.

### What Are NFTs?

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that cannot be exchanged one-for-one like traditional currency. For example, a 100billisinterchangeablewithanother100 bill is interchangeable with another 100billisinterchangeablewithanother100 bill regardless of markings or wear. However, an NFT is unique and cannot be swapped for an identical token.

### Real-World Example of Fungibility

Recently, while traveling in Costa Rica, I had a 10,000 Costa Rican colones bill that accidentally tore in half. I was concerned it was worthless, but the bank replaced it after verifying it was genuine. This illustrates how traditional currency is fungible and replaceable.

### The Concept of Unique Tokens on Blockchain

While cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are interchangeable tokens, NFTs are designed to be unique. They have distinct identifiers and features, often representing digital art or collectibles that are one of a kind.

### The Uniqueness of Digital Art

Consider the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. No matter how perfect a replica is, it cannot be the original Mona Lisa. Similarly, NFTs represent unique digital artworks that cannot be duplicated or sold as originals.

### The NFT Craze and Mainstream Adoption

NFTs have surged in popularity recently. For instance, Christie's auction house sold a digital art collection called "Everydays" by Beeple for over 69 million U.S. dollars. This collection consisted of a piece created every day for 5,000 days, showcasing the scale and value of NFTs.

### Building an NFT Marketplace

As developers, we can create platforms where users can mint, list, and sell NFTs. One of the largest existing marketplaces is OpenSea, where NFTs are bought and sold, often at high prices.

### Example: Bored Ape Yacht Club on OpenSea

The Bored Ape Yacht Club collection has 10,000 items listed on OpenSea, with prices averaging around 100 ETH. At current rates, 100 ETH is approximately 335,000 U.S. dollars, illustrating the high value of some NFTs.

### Platform Fees and Advantages

OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee on sales. This highlights that being the platform owner can be more profitable than being an individual creator, especially if you are not already famous.

### Project Overview

Our project is an NFT e-commerce site inspired by OpenSea. It will be built with React on the frontend and Motoko on the Internet Computer blockchain for the backend. Unlike many NFTs that store files on third-party servers, our NFTs will have their data stored directly on-chain.

### Current NFT Storage Practices

Most NFTs today store their original files on third-party servers like IPFS. For example, NFT number 5465 on OpenSea links to a contract address on Etherscan, which points to an IPFS URL where the actual image is hosted and accessible to anyone.

# Event Handling in React

## Introduction to Event Handling in React

In this lesson, we will discuss handling events in React, detecting user interactions with your app or components, and using React to render different things depending on those events.

## Example: Button Color Change on Mouse Events

By the end of this lesson, you will have built functionality where, as you mouse over a button, it turns black, and when you mouse away, it turns white. To implement this, we will combine concepts such as conditional rendering, inline styling, mouse events, and state management.

## Setting Up the Form

Start by forking the starting sandbox. The form consists of three components:

- An `h1` element that says "Hello"
- An input of type text with a placeholder asking for a name
- A Submit button

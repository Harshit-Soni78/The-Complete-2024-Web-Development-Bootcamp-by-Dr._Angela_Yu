# Set up your Google OAuth Credentials

## Setting up "Login with Google"

In the next lesson, you will create a button that allows users to log into your website using their google account. However, you'll first need to create your own credentials to use in the project (you can't use mine from the video).

You can use your Google/gmail account for the next steps.

## Sign in to your google cloud console

Navigate to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your Google/gmail account.

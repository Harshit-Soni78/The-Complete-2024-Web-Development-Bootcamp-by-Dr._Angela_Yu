# useState Hook Practice

## Introduction to useState Hook Practice

In this lesson, you will get more practice with the useState Hook. Begin by obtaining the starting sandbox and forking your own copy. Examine the challenge inside the index.js file, which consists of two parts.

## Challenge Overview

The first part of the challenge is to display the current time inside an h1 element every time the user presses the Get Time button. The current time can be obtained using a specific line of code, and it is currently being logged in the console. Modify the code inside App.jsx so that the time is shown in the h1 element whenever the button is pressed.

## Expected Behavior

When you refresh the app, it should load the time in the h1 element. Each time you click the Get Time button, the h1 should update to show the latest time at the moment the button is pressed. You can press it every second to update, and this is the goal for part 1 of the challenge.

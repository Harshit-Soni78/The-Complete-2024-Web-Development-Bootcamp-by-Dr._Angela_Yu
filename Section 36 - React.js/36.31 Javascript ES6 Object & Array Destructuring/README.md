# Javascript ES6 Object & Array Destructuring

## Introduction to Destructuring in JavaScript ES6

In this lesson, the concept of destructuring is explored, focusing on both objects and arrays. The goal is to clarify how destructuring works in JavaScript ES6 and to become familiar with its syntax.

If you are already comfortable with destructuring and have no issues using it, you may proceed to the challenge. The objective is to uncomment the code below the CHALLENGE line and render the stats from the `practice.js` file, where there is a constant called `cars`. This structure is an array containing two objects, each with nested objects and arrays.

The task is to use variable names to destructure the code from `practice.js` without altering any existing code. The table displays the Brand, Top Speed, and Top Color, all extracted from the `cars` array. The model corresponds to the first column, the top speed to the `topSpeed` property, and the top color is the first color in the array.

Errors in the console are unrelated to your code and are due to the HTML table structure in React. The focus is on destructuring, so the aim is to resolve errors by adding code to destructure the array inside `practice.js`.

If you are unsure where to start or get stuck, it is recommended to watch the video for a deeper dive into destructuring nested arrays, providing default values, and more. Begin by forking a copy of the starting sandbox. Initially, ignore the challenge and create space in `index.js`, starting with data from `data.js`.

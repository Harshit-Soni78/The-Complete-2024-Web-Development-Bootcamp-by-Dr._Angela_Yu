# What You'll Build - DBANK (Inspired by Compound)

## Introduction to Building a DeFi Application

We are going to get started by building our first decentralized finance (DeFi) application. In the process, we will learn how to program for the Internet Computer using the Motoko language.

## Project Inspiration: Compound Protocol

The project we are building is inspired by the Compound protocol, which is a money market protocol. Essentially, Compound allows people to lend and borrow their tokens.

For example, users can supply their Ether and earn interest on it, or borrow a token such as the Chainlink token, betting that the token's price will have decreased by the time they repay their loan.

Compound collects interest paid by borrowers and distributes that interest to lenders of the token, while also taking a small fee for the service.

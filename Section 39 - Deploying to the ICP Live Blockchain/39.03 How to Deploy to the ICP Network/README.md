# How to Deploy to the ICP Network

## Preparing for Deployment

Once cycles have been moved into the wallet and the wallet is linked, it is time to deploy the project. Ensure that you are inside the `dbank` project folder.

Run the following command to make sure all required packages are installed and up to date:

```bash
    npm install
```

If everything is already up to date, this process should only take a few seconds. Once completed, you can proceed to deploy the project.

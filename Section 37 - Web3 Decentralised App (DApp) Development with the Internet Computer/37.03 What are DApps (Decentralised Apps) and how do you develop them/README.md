# What are DApps (Decentralised Apps) and How Do You Develop Them?

## Introduction to Creating Decentralized Applications

Now that we understand what DApps, or decentralized applications, are, let's discuss how we can actually create them and the new opportunities they offer us. As mentioned, DApps form the backbone of Web3. This is how we will bring about the next iteration of the Internet by creating these decentralized applications.

## Transforming Business Models with DApps

This development brings a huge change in how companies are formed and how new tech startups are built. Traditionally, you would first build your startup and technology, deploy it, then raise venture capital funding. Hopefully, investors like your idea and product, and if you are lucky, you might eventually have an IPO and cash out.

In contrast, the Web3 approach completely flips this model on its head. Here, you build your startup and technology, but you can start releasing tokens to the public or to funds like venture capitalists immediately. You can begin selling tokens that enable people to use and interact with your technology, allowing you to raise money for your DApp from day one.

## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

The way you run your company is also transformed by blockchain technology. You can form Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, which replace traditional boards of directors and organizational charts. Token holders, through special governance tokens, can vote on the future direction of the company or DApp.

In these DAOs, users can contribute to the roadmap of the decentralized application. Everyone's incentives are aligned because if the application succeeds, the token price increases, making the tokens more valuable. Therefore, the company must make good decisions, and all DAO members are incentivized to participate and help the organization progress.

## Comparing Traditional and Web3 Fundraising: Dropbox vs. Filecoin

Consider the example of Dropbox, a successful startup that raised a series A funding round of 6 million dollars after coming out of Y Combinator. Dropbox allows users to store files on the cloud, accessible from anywhere, similar to Google Drive.

Now, compare this to Filecoin, a Web3 competitor that offers similar decentralized file storage across millions of computers on the Internet. Instead of a single company hosting the data, Filecoin's decentralized approach provides massive redundancy and accessibility.

Filecoin raised 257 million dollars through an initial coin offering (ICO), where the public could buy their minted coins. This amount dwarfs Dropbox's 6 million, illustrating how decentralized apps can raise funding earlier and often more than traditional methods like venture capital or angel investors.

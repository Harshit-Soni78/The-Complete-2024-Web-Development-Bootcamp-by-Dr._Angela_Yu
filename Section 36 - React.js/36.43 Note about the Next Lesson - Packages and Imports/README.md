# Note about the Next Lesson - Packages and Imports

## Quick note about the next lesson: React Dependencies & Styling the Keeper App

In the next lecture, weâ€™ll be using components from the Material UI (MUI) packages. The components being used in the lesson now need to be accessed via a different package name.

### **You should include the following latest packages in the package.json:**

```json
1. "@mui/icons-material": "^5.15.11",
2. "@mui/material": "^5.15.11",
3. "@emotion/react": "^11.11.4",
4. "@emotion/styled": "^11.11.0",
```

And in the `.jsx` files should import the icons and the components like so:

### **CreateArea.jsx**

```jsx
1. import AddIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Add";
2. import { Fab } from "@mui/material";
3. import { Zoom } from "@mui/material";
```

### **Header.jsx**

```jsx
1. import HighlightIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Highlight";
```

### **Note.jsx**

```jsx
1. import DeleteIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Delete";
```

This way you'll avoid any warnings and errors. This is also the code you'll see used in the downloadable completed projects.

### **Previous version of the code:**

This is the code you'll see in the video in the package.json. Use the new code above:

```json
1. "@material-ui/core": "4.6.1",
2. "@material-ui/icons":"4.5.1",
```

and in the .jsx files, you'll see these imports, but use the code from above instead:

#### CreateArea.jsx

```jsx
1. import AddIcon from "@material-ui/icons/Add";
2. import Fab from "@material-ui/core/Fab";
3. import Zoom from "@material-ui/core/Zoom";
```

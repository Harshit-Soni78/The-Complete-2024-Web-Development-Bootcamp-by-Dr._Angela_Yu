# AMA Insights: Learning to Code, Productivity, and Personal Growth

## Introduction

This is our second AMA to date, and it seems like the last one was quite well received. I received many messages on Twitter about how many push-ups you are doing, trying to beat my record, which is not that hard to do, to be honest. I am glad that my ranting into the camera is helping somebody out there. As long as it is useful for one person, I am happy to keep doing this.

## Recent Events and Personal Updates

Another month has passed, and lots of exciting things have happened. I was invited by the Cape Town government to give a talk about the sharing economy and how technology can be used to improve adoption. It was a really interesting event, full of cool people. More importantly, Cape Town is incredible; it is such a beautiful city. I was really shocked. Everywhere I looked was stunning. I am so jealous of those who live in Cape Town. From the stats, I see quite a few Udemy students are from South Africa, so big shout out to you guys because you live in one of the most beautiful places ever. I know there are problems, but there are problems everywhere. To be honest, it is not really that safe in London either. Even though I am thinking about moving somewhere else, I do not know yet where. If you have any good pointers or locations you are fond of, be sure to hit me up on Twitter @yu_angela.

## AMA Questions Overview

Enough about me. Let's talk more about AMA questions. You have been really active, and the team has sorted through many new questions for me to answer. The rest of my team is playing Portal 2 today, having some after-work fun. This is also pretty fun for me. Let's get started.

### Question from Victor Mameshyn

Victor asked: In your opinion, how many hours should a developer spend weekly working or learning to become a successful developer and be acquainted with the latest technologies in the field, for example, 35 hours working or 5 hours learning?

I have a strong opinion about this. In my experience, you need to spend about an hour a day at minimum to keep up with new developments and technologies. Web developers know how many new frameworks are released every week or month. It is really tough keeping on top of things. Based on my friends' experience in large tech companies, you do get time for R&D and learning, but it is kind of in your own time. Even if the company pays for it, it usually has to be related directly to your day-to-day job.

When we set up our company, we thought carefully about this because it is important to get the company culture right from the beginning. It was my decision that everyone who works at our company is entitled to one hour—not just any hour, but their best one hour, first thing in the morning from 9:00 to 10:00. That hour is blocked out for learning. It does not matter what you want to learn. If you are an iOS developer, you can learn about blockchain development. If you are a machine learning person, you can learn about augmented reality. It really does not matter as long as it is something you want to learn and you can dedicate that one hour of prime brain time to it.

Running a company is about finding really smart people who want to work for you and keeping them around. Smart people tend to have a need to learn, including you. Why are you enrolled in this course? Because you are curious and intelligent and want to further your knowledge, breadth, or depth of your skill set. This is fundamental and important to our company, and every employee, no matter how senior, gets this privilege. It has been there from the beginning and will continue going forward.

I recommend you try to spend an hour of your best brain time every day to learn something new. It does not even have to be programming related; it can be design or the latest growth hacks. The main point is to pick and choose when you learn. Your hour after work, after dinner at maybe 9 PM, is not going to be as effective as your one hour in the morning after you have just woken up. If you can dictate your own time, I recommend between 9 and 10 or 9 and 11 for learning. If you cannot, and you work from 9 to 5, you need the discipline to wake up earlier and allocate your time wisely to dedicate your good brain to learning rather than at the end of the day when it is all mush.

In my day, I have a threshold for work. If I can operate at above 80% efficiency, I dedicate it to creative work such as creating new course content or learning new technologies. If I achieve brain efficiency above 50%, I do mundane tasks like answering emails and signing documents. If my brain efficiency is less than 50%, where I do not feel productive, I will not work. That does not mean I procrastinate on social media because that also takes energy. Instead, I rest by going for a walk, going to the gym, or meditating—something that does not require logical brain activity but physical activity to reset. It is like shutting down and restarting, and it helps me a lot.

It is important not just to think about how many hours you are learning or working but also what kind of time you dedicate to learning. Are you dedicating your effective brain time or your less effective brain time? Regarding how long you should work on programming problems to become better, it is not straightforward. Some people have creative and challenging jobs, while others, especially senior ones, can do their work with their eyes closed. To get more efficient, you have to work on problems that stretch you, chasing the sweet spot just above your competence to keep learning and growing.

### Question from Simon Fitch

Simon asked: Can you recommend a website where we can practice beginner to intermediate Swift coding examples and challenges?

I have seen this question a few times. It is a good question because instructors often recommend learning a little every day, but what exactly do you do every day? How do you find programming challenges to practice? I have a few favorite resources.

One is Project Euler, a website where you can browse many questions sorted by how many people have solved them, indicating difficulty. The more people who have solved a problem, the easier it probably is. The most difficult ones, solved by only a few, are real challenges. These problems are algorithm-oriented and can be solved using any programming language since fundamentals are the same.

Another recommendation is CodeFights. You can sign up, select your language (Swift 3 is fine despite Swift 4 being newer), and browse the arcade with relatively simple problems. The website has many tests, similar to test-driven development, focusing on algorithms. Start with the arcade for beginner to intermediate levels and then move to challenges sorted by difficulty. You can view solutions after attempting problems. This is a nice way to practice regularly and improve at algorithms and UI/front-end development.

The most important thing is to make apps. You are on an app-making course, so it is crucial to apply your skills to problems where the pathway is not laid out. Whether you become an independent developer, start a business, or work at a startup or tech company, you must figure things out yourself. Throughout the course, I have laid down fundamentals like how to access iOS documentation, interpret it, find example code, open source libraries, and use Stack Overflow. You do not have to make anything difficult; just try to build something we have not built before, like a timer or something you specifically need.

Recently, I read a book by Ray Dalio, who leads one of the biggest hedge funds. At Bridgewater, they have an internal app called The Pain Button. Whenever you experience pain—emotional, intellectual, or frustration—you log it in the app to come back later and develop processes or solutions. I thought this was a great idea. I searched the App Store and found no external version. If anyone wants an easy app to make, this is feasible. Let me know if you make it because I will download it.

Look for pain points or ways to scratch your own itch. Any small problem you have can be turned into an app for practice. There is a great website called 365 Projects, created by a lady who made a new website every day to improve her web development skills. This is a good idea for app developers too. Make a new app that takes less than two hours, which is definitely feasible. Examples include story cubes, a notepad, or a meditation music player. These are all feasible within your abilities as a beginner to intermediate iOS developer.

### Question from Alberto Martinez

Alberto asked: How many languages do you speak, both programming and real languages?

I speak English and Mandarin Chinese fluently, reading and writing both effectively. People often ask about my accent, which has elements of an Australian accent, though I have never been to Australia. I think I pick up accents from extensive exposure. When I moved to the UK at age 10, I did not know English and learned it by immersion. I was sociable and loved talking to people, which helped me pick up the language quickly in less than six months. This may explain why my accent is fluid, as I was never formally taught English but learned mostly by feel.

I also speak some French and German, having studied them for four or five years, but I am not yet proficient enough to do AMAs in those languages. I am working on it.

Regarding programming languages, the first I learned was Visual Basic using Visual Studio, which was easy to pick up. I had a logical mind and was disciplined as a child, spending summer holidays building video games for hours. After Visual Basic, I moved on to C, which was hard for a 12-year-old due to pointers and complexity, but it gave me a good foundation. Then I learned C++ to build real video games, followed by Objective-C for iOS apps, then Swift. Later, I learned JavaScript and various frameworks for web development.

Learning one real language, like English, and then another, like German, is a bigger jump than learning new programming languages once you know one. Programming languages share concepts, so switching from Swift to Java is easier because the abstract concepts are the same; only syntax changes. Programming is not real-time communication, so you can look up concepts like delegates and protocols in Java and find equivalents like interfaces. Once you master one language, learning others is much easier.

Programming languages can be categorized into procedural, object-oriented, and newer, more fancy languages. Ultimately, all aim to use the machine's processing power efficiently to perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, and division.

There is a humorous post comparing programming languages to weapons:

- C is an old but reliable Garand issue rifle.
- C++ is a set of nunchucks: powerful but painful to master.
- Perl is a Molotov cocktail: useful once but rarely used now.
- Java is a belt-fed 240G automatic weapon that sometimes jams causing null pointer exceptions.
- Swift avoids such problems with optional rules.
- Scala is like Java but with an incomprehensible training manual.
- JavaScript is a sword without a hilt, scary to use.
- Bash is a cursed hammer that makes everything look like a nail.
- Ruby is a shiny, ruby-encrusted sword.
- Lisp is a shiv, used by crazy and dangerous people.

Another post humorously describes rescuing a princess using eight programming languages, highlighting the complexity and frustrations of some languages.

### Question from Sinead

Sinead, a former doctor, asked how I manage eating when working long periods.

I was drawn to the idea of Soylent, a nutritionally complete milk protein powder shake, to code for 12 hours straight without spending time on food. However, it tastes horrible, like a cardboard box soaked in old bath water blended into a smoothie. Although they have improved their formulas, I could not continue with it.

I advocate for high protein and low carbohydrate intake because carbs cause me to feel lethargic and less productive. Often, I start my day with a can of sardines and have protein shakes throughout the day, along with proper meals. During programming stints, especially at night, I eat less and stick to protein shakes. This is not medical advice; always consult your doctor.

One of my biggest body hack experiments in 2017 was quitting sugar. After researching, I found that cutting out refined sugar is beneficial for inflammation and mental clarity. For the first two days, I experienced flu-like symptoms and nervousness, but by the seventh day, I felt mentally sharp and productive. Sugar is addictive, and cutting it out improved my energy and performance. I recommend trying to cut out refined sugar for two weeks to see the effects.

### Question from Jonas Elholm

Jonas asked: How many cups of coffee in a row can a person handle a day? Five or ten cups from a doctor's point of view?

I cannot give medical advice; please consult your doctor. When I need motivation for daunting tasks, I rely on an app called Caffeine Zone, created by professors at Penn State University. It estimates caffeine intake based on drink and size, personal details like weight, and charts caffeine half-life decay. It notifies you to drink more coffee to stay within a productive caffeine zone. I have used it since medical school. The app has a free version with ads. If anyone wants to build a better version with improved UX and UI, I would be the first to download it.

## Conclusion

It is now getting dark in London, and my team looks ready to go to the pub. We will call it a day for this month. Next month, I have a secret surprise for those on the course, which will be pretty awesome and make many of you happy. Keep an eye out for an email around mid-December. As always, send your AMA questions in the comments below the announcement or add your question to the AMA lesson QA. That's all from me, and I hope to see you next month.

## Key Takeaways

- Dedicate at least one hour of your best brain time daily to learning new skills, not necessarily related to programming.
- Practice programming through algorithm challenges on websites like Project Euler and CodeFights, and by building your own apps.
- Learning new programming languages becomes easier once you understand core programming concepts.
- Maintaining mental clarity and productivity can be supported by proper nutrition and managing caffeine intake effectively.

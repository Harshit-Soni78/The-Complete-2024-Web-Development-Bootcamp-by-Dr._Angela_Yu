# How to Convert ICP into Cycles?

## Introduction to Cycles and ICP Tokens

One important aspect to be aware of is that cycles can run out. This may happen if you have created too many new canisters or hosted a file that is too large. When this occurs, you either have to continue with local development or acquire some ICP tokens.

Typically, the way to obtain ICP tokens is through a cryptocurrency exchange. Using an exchange, you can buy ICP tokens with your local currency, such as dollars or pounds. The largest and most established exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, and KuCoin, among others.

## Earning ICP Tokens for Free via Coinbase

Here is a neat trick on how you can get ICP tokens for free. Coinbase has a "Learn and Earn" section where you can take quizzes about various blockchain projects and earn their tokens as rewards.

For example, at the moment, there is a prize for learning about Fetch.ai. You can read through the material, complete the quiz, and earn prizes in the form of tokens in that currency.

After earning 3 FET tokens, you can go back to the Buy and Sell section and convert your FET tokens into Internet Computer (ICP) tokens. By pressing "Convert All," you will see the current exchange rate, which fluctuates every second.

Clicking "Convert Now" will allow you to obtain some ICP tokens for free.

## Transferring ICP Tokens to the Network Nervous System Wallet

Once you have acquired ICP tokens, the next step is to convert them into cycles. To do this, navigate to the Network Nervous System and log in.

After logging in and authorizing, click on the ICP tab to view your wallet address associated with your principal. If you currently have zero ICP, copy this wallet address.

Return to Coinbase, go to the Send and Receive section, select ICP as the payment method, and send your ICP tokens to the copied wallet address. You can send all your ICP tokens or a specific amount.

After confirming and sending, the transaction will be processed. Refresh the Network Nervous System page to verify that the ICP tokens have been transferred to your account.

## Converting ICP Tokens into Cycles

With ICP tokens in your account, you can now convert some of them into cycles. First, navigate to the Canisters section and click on "Create or Link a Canister." Link it to your wallet by copying your wallet's canister ID.

Alternatively, you can obtain your wallet canister ID via the command line by running:

```bash
    dfx identity --network ic get-wallet
```

After obtaining the canister ID, click "Attach Canister." Occasionally, you may encounter an error stating, "You are not the controller of this canister and cannot access its details," but this usually resolves itself.

Next, add cycles to this wallet by selecting "Main" as your source account and specifying the amount of cycles to add. The minimum amount is two cycles.

Review your cycle purchase, which will show the amount of ICP to be converted into terra cycles (trillion cycles). Confirm and send the transaction.

Once the transaction is completed, refresh your cycles wallet. You may need to log in and authenticate again. Sometimes, you might see a "register device" prompt if the system does not recognize your device, but refreshing the page usually updates the status.

After refreshing, your balance will be updated, showing the added terra cycles and the topped-up balance.

# What are DApps (Decentralised Apps) and How Do You Develop Them?

## Introduction to Creating Decentralized Applications

Now that we understand what DApps, or decentralized applications, are, let's discuss how we can actually create them and the new opportunities they offer us. As mentioned, DApps form the backbone of Web3. This is how we will bring about the next iteration of the Internet by creating these decentralized applications.

## Transforming Business Models with DApps

This development brings a huge change in how companies are formed and how new tech startups are built. Traditionally, you would first build your startup and technology, deploy it, then raise venture capital funding. Hopefully, investors like your idea and product, and if you are lucky, you might eventually have an IPO and cash out.

In contrast, the Web3 approach completely flips this model on its head. Here, you build your startup and technology, but you can start releasing tokens to the public or to funds like venture capitalists immediately. You can begin selling tokens that enable people to use and interact with your technology, allowing you to raise money for your DApp from day one.

## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

The way you run your company is also transformed by blockchain technology. You can form Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, which replace traditional boards of directors and organizational charts. Token holders, through special governance tokens, can vote on the future direction of the company or DApp.

In these DAOs, users can contribute to the roadmap of the decentralized application. Everyone's incentives are aligned because if the application succeeds, the token price increases, making the tokens more valuable. Therefore, the company must make good decisions, and all DAO members are incentivized to participate and help the organization progress.

# JavaScript ES6 Destructuring Challenge Solution

## Introduction to the Challenge Solution

This article presents the solution to the JavaScript ES6 destructuring challenge from the previous lesson. We begin by commenting out the previous code and importing a constant named `cars` from the `practice.js` file. This array contains objects representing different car models with nested properties and arrays, resembling typical API response data.

```js
// Import cars array from practice.js
import cars from "./practice.js";
```

After importing the `cars` array, we log it to the console to inspect its structure. It is an array with two objects, each containing multiple properties, nested objects, and nested arrays. This structure is common when working with API data.

# What You'll Build - A Website to Mint, Buy and Sell NFTs

## Introduction to the NFT Marketplace Project

We are about to embark on an exciting project: building an NFT marketplace where users can mint, list, and sell non-fungible tokens on the Internet Computer.

### What Are NFTs?

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that cannot be exchanged one-for-one like traditional currency. For example, a 100billisinterchangeablewithanother100 bill is interchangeable with another 100billisinterchangeablewithanother100 bill regardless of markings or wear. However, an NFT is unique and cannot be swapped for an identical token.

### Real-World Example of Fungibility

Recently, while traveling in Costa Rica, I had a 10,000 Costa Rican colones bill that accidentally tore in half. I was concerned it was worthless, but the bank replaced it after verifying it was genuine. This illustrates how traditional currency is fungible and replaceable.

### The Concept of Unique Tokens on Blockchain

While cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are interchangeable tokens, NFTs are designed to be unique. They have distinct identifiers and features, often representing digital art or collectibles that are one of a kind.

### The Uniqueness of Digital Art

Consider the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. No matter how perfect a replica is, it cannot be the original Mona Lisa. Similarly, NFTs represent unique digital artworks that cannot be duplicated or sold as originals.

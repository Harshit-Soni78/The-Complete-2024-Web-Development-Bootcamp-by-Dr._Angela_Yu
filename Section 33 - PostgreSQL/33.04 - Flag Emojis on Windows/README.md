# Flag Emojis on Windows ?

## Windows does not display flag images for emoji

In the next couple of lessons you will see various country's flags being displayed in the videos. However, Microsoft Windows does not natively display the images of flags and you won't see flags in VS Code or pgAdmin. Instead, Windows will show you the country code which looks this:

**But don't worry!** The important thing for our web development projects is how the flags are displayed in the browser (and _not_ how the emojis are displayed in .csv files or pgAdmin).

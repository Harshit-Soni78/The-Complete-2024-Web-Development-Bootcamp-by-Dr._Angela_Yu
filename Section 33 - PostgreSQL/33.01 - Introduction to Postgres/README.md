# Introduction to Postgres

We are now ready to start learning about Postgres. This will be our Database Management System used to persist data across our web applications.

Postgres is chosen because it is widely used by many top companies such as Apple, Twitch, Instagram, and even NASA. This makes it more than sufficient for our purposes.

Postgres describes itself as "The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database." This means it is widely adopted in the industry, free, and open source, so no cost is required to use this powerful technology.

In addition to being free, learning Postgres opens great career opportunities because of its widespread use across many companies and industries. It also benefits from strong community support due to its popularity among professional developers.

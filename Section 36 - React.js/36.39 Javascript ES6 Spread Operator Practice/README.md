## Introduction to the To-Do List Challenge

In this challenge, you will apply various concepts learned so far to build a functional to-do list. The goal is to create a list where you can add new items, such as "Buy milk", by typing into an input field and clicking the Add button. The items will then appear as bullet points in a list.

### Challenge Requirements

- When text is entered into the input, the state should update to reflect the current input value.
- When the Add button is pressed, the current input value should be saved and added to an array.
- The unordered list (`ul`) should display all items from the array as individual list items (`li`).

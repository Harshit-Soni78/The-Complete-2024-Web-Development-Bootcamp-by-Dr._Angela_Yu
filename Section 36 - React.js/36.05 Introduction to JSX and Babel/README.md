# Introduction to JSX and Babel

This lesson introduces JSX and Babel, essential tools for modern React development. The course resources provide a link to a sandbox for experimenting with JSX.

## Setting Up the Project

After accessing the sandbox, you can fork the project and log in with GitHub to save your work. Free users have a limit of ten projects in the Drafts folder, but you can download your project as a zip file and extract it to view and run locally.

Inside the EXPLORER, you will see the `public` and `src` folders. The only file with code initially is `index.html`, which serves as the entry point. It contains a simple HTML structure with a `head` linking to `styles.css` and a `body` with a single `div` with an id of `root`. This `div` is the root of your React application, where all React components will be rendered.

At the bottom of `index.html`, there is a script linking to `index.js`. Currently, the website does not do anything except display the title, which you are encouraged to update to "JSX" for this lesson.

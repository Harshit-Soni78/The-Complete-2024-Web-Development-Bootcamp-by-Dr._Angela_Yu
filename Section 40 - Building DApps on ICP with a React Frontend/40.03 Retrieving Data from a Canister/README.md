# Retrieving Data from a Canister

Now that we have managed to create a Note and add it to our back-end, the next step is to retrieve these notes that we have stored and display them on the front-end. This back and forth is necessary to persist our data across time.

Currently, whenever we create a Note and refresh our front end, it disappears. However, it does get added to our back-end. You can see our notes list contains the notes we have added, including any test entries.

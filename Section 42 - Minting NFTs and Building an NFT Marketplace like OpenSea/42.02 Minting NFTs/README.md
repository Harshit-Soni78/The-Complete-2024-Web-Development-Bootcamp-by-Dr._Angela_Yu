# Minting NFTs on the Internet Computer: Project Setup and Canister Deployment

## Introduction

This lesson covers the process of setting up and minting NFTs on the Internet Computer using Motoko. The steps include project setup, canister creation, configuration, deployment, and verification.

## Project Setup

First, download the opend starter compressed zip file from the Course Resources and unzip it. Move the folder to your project directory. Open the project in VS Code. Inside the `src` folder, you will find a `main.mo` file, which is mostly empty, and an `assets` file containing most of the frontend HTML and styling. The focus will be on ensuring the backend and frontend work together.

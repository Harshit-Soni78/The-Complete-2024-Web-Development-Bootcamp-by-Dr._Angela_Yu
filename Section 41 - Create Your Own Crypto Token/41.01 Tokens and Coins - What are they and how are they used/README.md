# Tokens and Coins: What are they and how are they used?

## Introduction to Creating Tokens on the Internet Computer

In this lecture, we will learn how to create your own tokens on the Internet Computer. This is an exciting opportunity because you have probably heard about tokens like Shiba Inu, Doge, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Now, we will create our own custom tokens, such as Angela Coin or Amy Coin, and explore how building these crypto tokens on the blockchain actually works.

### Difference Between Tokens and Coins

A common question is: What is the difference between a token and a coin? For example, you might hear about the Shiba Inu token or the Doge coin. The key distinction is that to have a coin, you need your own blockchain, which means building a blockchain from scratch. In contrast, tokens take advantage of existing blockchains such as Ethereum or the Internet Computer blockchain.

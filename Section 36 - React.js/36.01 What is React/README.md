# What is React

## Introduction to React

Today, we will explore React, a powerful web framework. This extensive 10-hour module will teach you the ins and outs of React and how to use it to build beautiful user interfaces for your websites and web applications.

React is highly sought after in the web development community. According to the latest Stack Overflow survey, React JS is both one of the most loved and most wanted web frameworks, surpassing Angular, Vue, and many others.

### What is React?

React is defined on its official website as "a JavaScript library for building user interfaces." Essentially, it is a front-end framework designed to make it easier and faster to build beautiful user interfaces, such as those seen on Airbnb.

One of React's greatest strengths is its ability to create repetitive elements efficiently. For example, on Airbnb, tiles display different pieces of information like ratings or the SUPERHOST tag. Each of these elements works similarly across listings. React allows you to create a single component and customize it with different data to build an entire user interface like Airbnb's.

Effectively, React breaks down a complex user interface into a component tree. For instance, a web app can be represented as a component containing a NavBar component, a ToDoList component, and inside that, ListItem components. Each ListItem can include Checkbox and ItemText components, all reusable and customizable. This approach lets you write less code while creating more beautiful user interfaces.

### Simplifying Website Structure

React vastly simplifies website structure. For example, creating a simple Navbar with Bootstrap requires writing a lot of HTML, which can be hard to organize and debug. In React, components are represented as if they were HTML elements, allowing you to create custom elements with defined styling and functionality. These components can be slotted into an overall structure, keeping your web app's code clean, reusable, and modular.

This modularity is excellent for programming clean code and building apps that scale well, even when they become large and complex. You can think of components as ingredients in a burger; depending on your needs, you can mix and match components and customize them accordingly.

# What are DApps (Decentralised Apps) and How Do You Develop Them?

## Introduction to Creating Decentralized Applications

Now that we understand what DApps, or decentralized applications, are, let's discuss how we can actually create them and the new opportunities they offer us. As mentioned, DApps form the backbone of Web3. This is how we will bring about the next iteration of the Internet by creating these decentralized applications.

## Transforming Business Models with DApps

This development brings a huge change in how companies are formed and how new tech startups are built. Traditionally, you would first build your startup and technology, deploy it, then raise venture capital funding. Hopefully, investors like your idea and product, and if you are lucky, you might eventually have an IPO and cash out.

In contrast, the Web3 approach completely flips this model on its head. Here, you build your startup and technology, but you can start releasing tokens to the public or to funds like venture capitalists immediately. You can begin selling tokens that enable people to use and interact with your technology, allowing you to raise money for your DApp from day one.

# What are DApps (Decentralised Apps) and How Do You Develop Them?

## Introduction to Creating Decentralized Applications

Now that we understand what DApps, or decentralized applications, are, let's discuss how we can actually create them and the new opportunities they offer us. As mentioned, DApps form the backbone of Web3. This is how we will bring about the next iteration of the Internet by creating these decentralized applications.

## Transforming Business Models with DApps

This development brings a huge change in how companies are formed and how new tech startups are built. Traditionally, you would first build your startup and technology, deploy it, then raise venture capital funding. Hopefully, investors like your idea and product, and if you are lucky, you might eventually have an IPO and cash out.

In contrast, the Web3 approach completely flips this model on its head. Here, you build your startup and technology, but you can start releasing tokens to the public or to funds like venture capitalists immediately. You can begin selling tokens that enable people to use and interact with your technology, allowing you to raise money for your DApp from day one.

## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

The way you run your company is also transformed by blockchain technology. You can form Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, which replace traditional boards of directors and organizational charts. Token holders, through special governance tokens, can vote on the future direction of the company or DApp.

In these DAOs, users can contribute to the roadmap of the decentralized application. Everyone's incentives are aligned because if the application succeeds, the token price increases, making the tokens more valuable. Therefore, the company must make good decisions, and all DAO members are incentivized to participate and help the organization progress.

## Comparing Traditional and Web3 Fundraising: Dropbox vs. Filecoin

Consider the example of Dropbox, a successful startup that raised a series A funding round of 6 million dollars after coming out of Y Combinator. Dropbox allows users to store files on the cloud, accessible from anywhere, similar to Google Drive.

Now, compare this to Filecoin, a Web3 competitor that offers similar decentralized file storage across millions of computers on the Internet. Instead of a single company hosting the data, Filecoin's decentralized approach provides massive redundancy and accessibility.

Filecoin raised 257 million dollars through an initial coin offering (ICO), where the public could buy their minted coins. This amount dwarfs Dropbox's 6 million, illustrating how decentralized apps can raise funding earlier and often more than traditional methods like venture capital or angel investors.

## The Exciting Future of Decentralized Applications

The future of decentralized applications is very promising. Anything involving a trustless, decentralized system that benefits both users and creators can be achieved. For example, instead of Uber drivers being exploited by Uber, you could have a user-and-driver-owned version of Uber. Everyone involved could receive tokens to govern and determine how the company operates, effectively owning shares as the company grows.

You could also realize innovative ideas like online racing games where participants pay an entry fee, and winners receive cash prizes.

## Pseudonymity in Web3

Another significant benefit of Web3 is pseudonymity. This means you can be identified by a handle or username, preserving your privacy without revealing your real name or address. You can create valuable contributions and be recognized and rewarded by your pseudonym.

This acts as a great equalizer, as it does not matter who you are, your race, gender, or age. Recognition is based solely on your work. For instance, three teenagers who created a decentralized finance project called Rari Capital, which simplifies lending and borrowing on blockchain, were interviewed by Forbes. They started building on the blockchain at age 16 and were able to raise funding and gain respect based on their work, despite their young age.

## Getting Started with Building DApps: Choosing a Blockchain

Now that you are ready to start building DApps, the first step is to choose a blockchain to build on. Options include Avalanche, Polkadot, Solana, among others. Currently, the largest number of DApps are built on Ethereum, primarily because it was the first blockchain to support smart contracts, allowing code to be embedded directly into the blockchain.

However, Ethereum has fundamental problems that limit its suitability for Web3 DApps, the biggest being scalability. It is costly to perform computation and store data on Ethereum. For example, NFTs minted on Ethereum are not stored on-chain; instead, only a URL is stored, with the actual image hosted elsewhere, such as on IPFS through Filecoin or on private servers like Amazon AWS.

## Limitations of Ethereum and the Internet Computer Solution

The main challenges with developing decentralized applications on Ethereum include high costs for computation and storage, and the difficulty of having a proper backend with a database. As a result, many Ethereum-based DApps are composed of a patchwork of different services. For instance, their websites, including CSS, JavaScript, and images, are often hosted on centralized services like Amazon AWS.

To address these issues, the Internet Computer project was initiated by the Dfinity team as early as 2014. The goal is to build a scalable cloud computer that runs on a blockchain, combining the benefits of a trustless decentralized system with the ability to perform fast computations, store data directly on-chain, and create fully-fledged applications on the blockchain.

This module will focus on building decentralized applications using the Internet Computer. The next lesson will delve deeper into how it works and how to get started building DApps on it.

## Key Takeaways

- Decentralized applications (DApps) are the foundation of Web3, enabling a new model for building startups and raising funds.
- Web3 startups can raise money from day one by issuing tokens, transforming company governance through Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).
- Web3 offers benefits like pseudonymity, allowing creators to be recognized for their work regardless of identity.
- Ethereum, while pioneering smart contracts, faces scalability and cost issues, leading to alternatives like the Internet Computer for building scalable, fully on-chain DApps.

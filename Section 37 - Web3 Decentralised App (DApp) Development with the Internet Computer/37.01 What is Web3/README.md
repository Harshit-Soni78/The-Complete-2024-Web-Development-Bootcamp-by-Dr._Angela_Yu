# What is Web3?

## Introduction to Web3 and the Future of Web Development

Welcome to a new module in the Web Development Course. This module is designed to keep you at the forefront of technology trends in 2022 and beyond. We are collaborating with the Dfinity Foundation to explore blockchain technology and its development.

A recent poll involving 2,834 participants revealed that Web3 and blockchain technology are the most anticipated areas to learn, receiving 44.6% of the votes. This highlights the growing interest and importance of these technologies.

## The Growing Demand for Blockchain Developers

According to a LinkedIn survey, job opportunities for machine learning engineers have grown 12 times, but blockchain developer positions have increased 33 times. This rapid growth reflects the expanding blockchain ecosystem and the urgent need for skilled developers.

The starting salary for junior blockchain developers in the United States is approximately $120,000, making it a highly lucrative career path compared to traditional web or mobile development roles.

As of early 2022, the number of active blockchain or Web3 developers is experiencing significant growth, a trend expected to continue for the next five years.

## Understanding Web3

Web3 is essentially the new internet. Similar to the Internet boom of the late 1990s, Web3 is attracting massive investment and interest as it begins to take off.

Web 3.0 refers to the third stage of the web's evolution:

- **Web 1.0** (1990s): The read-only web, where users could only browse static websites such as GeoCities, Yahoo!, and Ask Jeeves.
- **Web 2.0**: The interactive web, characterized by platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit, where users create and interact with content.
- **Web 3.0**: The decentralized web, built on blockchain technology, enabling new types of applications and user control.

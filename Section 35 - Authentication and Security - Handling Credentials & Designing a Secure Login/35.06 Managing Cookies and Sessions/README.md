# Managing Cookies and Sessions

## Introduction to Cookies and Sessions

In this lesson, we will discuss cookies and sessions in web development. While the term "cookies" might evoke thoughts of delicious treats, in web development, cookies are more like fortune cookiesâ€”they contain a message packaged inside that can be passed around and revealed.

For example, when you visit Amazon and search for a Nintendo Switch, then add it to your basket, Amazon creates a cookie stored in your browser. This cookie does not contain the actual item details but an ID used to fetch your cart contents during your browsing session.

You can view cookies in Chrome by navigating to Settings, searching for "cookie," and accessing "See all cookies and site data." Here, you will find cookies like session-token and session-id associated with amazon.co.uk, which help maintain your shopping cart state even if you close and reopen your browser.

If you delete these cookies and refresh the website, Amazon will forget your previous session, and your cart will be empty. Cookies are widely used to save browsing sessions and enable features like retargeting ads, where other websites remind you of items you viewed on Amazon.

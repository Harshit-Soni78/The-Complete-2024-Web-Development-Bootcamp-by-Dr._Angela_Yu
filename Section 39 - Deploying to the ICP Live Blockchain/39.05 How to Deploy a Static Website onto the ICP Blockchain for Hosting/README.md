# How to Deploy a Static Website onto the ICP Blockchain for Hosting

## Introduction

This lesson demonstrates how to deploy a static website onto the Internet Computer, making it accessible globally. The process is simple and cost-effective, especially for small sites.

## Preparing the Static Website

To begin, download the provided CSS - My Site resource from the course materials. After downloading, unzip the file to reveal the `index.html` file. Double-clicking on `index.html` will open the simple website developed during the CSS lesson.

## Reviewing the File Structure

The website folder contains:

- A `CSS` folder with styles
- A favicon
- Several small images
- The `index.html` file

The total size is only a few hundred kilobytes, making it inexpensive to deploy and host on the Internet Computer.

## Bundling Assets

Bundle all files into a new folder named `assets`. This folder will contain all the website's assets. In previous projects, such as dbank, a similar `dbank_assets` folder was used to store CSS, logos, `index.html`, and `index.js` files.

# What is the Internet Computer (ICP)?

## Introduction to the Internet Computer

What exactly is the Internet Computer, and how can we build decentralized applications (DApps) using it? The goal of the Internet Computer is to reach blockchain singularity. This means creating a powerful, secure blockchain capable of running the entire base layer of the web. Essentially, it aims to provide everything from hosting and storage to services within one secure protocol.

Back in 2019, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum and the pioneer of smart contracts, was asked at Unchained Live about the biggest competitor to Ethereum. His answer was Dfinity's Internet Computer. This is partly because today's decentralized applications are only partially decentralized. They host a small amount of logic and data on a secure blockchain, but the majority of their logic and data reside on large Web2 companies.

For example, many DApps use Amazon's AWS or Microsoft Azure to host data, or rely on browser extensions like Chrome's to connect wallets and enable users to spend and earn tokens. If most of a DApp is not on-chain, it is not truly decentralized and lacks the full benefits of decentralization. This means companies like Amazon or Microsoft could shut down your project at any time.

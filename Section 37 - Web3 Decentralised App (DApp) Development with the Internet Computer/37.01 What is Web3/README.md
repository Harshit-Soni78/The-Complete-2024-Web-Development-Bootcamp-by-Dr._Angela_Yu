# What is Web3?

## Introduction to Web3 and the Future of Web Development

Welcome to a new module in the Web Development Course. This module is designed to keep you at the forefront of technology trends in 2022 and beyond. We are collaborating with the Dfinity Foundation to explore blockchain technology and its development.

A recent poll involving 2,834 participants revealed that Web3 and blockchain technology are the most anticipated areas to learn, receiving 44.6% of the votes. This highlights the growing interest and importance of these technologies.

## The Growing Demand for Blockchain Developers

According to a LinkedIn survey, job opportunities for machine learning engineers have grown 12 times, but blockchain developer positions have increased 33 times. This rapid growth reflects the expanding blockchain ecosystem and the urgent need for skilled developers.

The starting salary for junior blockchain developers in the United States is approximately $120,000, making it a highly lucrative career path compared to traditional web or mobile development roles.

As of early 2022, the number of active blockchain or Web3 developers is experiencing significant growth, a trend expected to continue for the next five years.

## Understanding Web3

Web3 is essentially the new internet. Similar to the Internet boom of the late 1990s, Web3 is attracting massive investment and interest as it begins to take off.

Web 3.0 refers to the third stage of the web's evolution:

- **Web 1.0** (1990s): The read-only web, where users could only browse static websites such as GeoCities, Yahoo!, and Ask Jeeves.
- **Web 2.0**: The interactive web, characterized by platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit, where users create and interact with content.
- **Web 3.0**: The decentralized web, built on blockchain technology, enabling new types of applications and user control.

## The Dawn of Web3 Applications

Since 2018, developers have been building applications on the blockchain, marking the beginning of Web3. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are well-known, this module focuses on building Web3 applications rather than investment advice.

As developers, we have the power to shape the future of Web3 by creating innovative applications. Examples include:

- **Helium**: A decentralized wireless network providing internet access in remote areas through individual 5G network hosts who earn cryptocurrency.
- **PoolTogether**: A no-loss lottery where participants pool money to earn interest, which is awarded to a winner, while allowing participants to withdraw their original funds anytime.
- **Axie Infinity**: A blockchain-based game similar to Pok√©mon, where players can buy, sell, and trade digital creatures called Axies, generating significant revenue for developers through transaction fees.

For instance, Axie Infinity has seen nearly 3millionintradeswithin24hours,generatingapproximately3 million in trades within 24 hours, generating approximately 3millionintradeswithin24hours,generatingapproximately127,000 in developer fees, surpassing earnings of some mainstream triple-A games. This illustrates the immense potential of Web3 applications.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Web3 presents one of the biggest opportunities in technology for 2022 and beyond. To develop Web3 applications, it is essential to first understand how blockchain technology works. This module will guide you through these fundamentals and prepare you to build the future of the internet.

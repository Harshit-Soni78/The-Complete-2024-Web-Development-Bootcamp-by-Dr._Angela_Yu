# JSX Code Practice

## Introduction to the Challenge

In this challenge, you will work with a prepared CodeSandbox environment. The first step is to fork the CodeSandbox so that you can keep a copy of your work. If you are logged in, you will be able to save your progress and return to it later.

The goal is to create a React application from scratch by following the comments step by step and completing the challenge accordingly.

## Project Setup

Inside the `index.js` file, all existing code has been removed to give you extra practice creating React apps. The `index.html` file contains the predictable `div` with the id of `root`.

By the end of this challenge, you should have created a website using React that includes:

- An `h1` heading
- An unordered list (`ul`) with three list items (`li`)

For example, a list of favorite foods can be displayed with a heading and three bullet points.

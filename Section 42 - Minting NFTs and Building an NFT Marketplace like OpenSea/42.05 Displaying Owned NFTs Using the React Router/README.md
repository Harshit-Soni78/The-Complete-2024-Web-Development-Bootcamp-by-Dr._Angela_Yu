# Displaying Owned NFTs Using the React Router

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, the user interface for minting NFTs was created, allowing for the programmatic creation of new containers, each containing a unique non-fungible token. Once minted, the loader functioned correctly, and the frontend was formatted to display the newly created NFTs. After the backend canisters are created, the data can be pulled in and shown to the user.

## Viewing Minted NFTs

When minting multiple tokens, it is important to provide a way to view all of them. This is accomplished within the 'My NFTs' tab, which should display a gallery of all NFTs owned or minted by the user. At this stage, the NFTs owned are the same as those minted, as that is currently the only way to acquire NFTs.
